    "# War card game analysis\n",
    "Assumptions:\n",
    "- if there are n players, then there every player gets *(52 mod n)* cards and there are *(52 mod n) * n* cards in game\n",
    "- non-playing cards are chosen from the lowest ones\n",
    "- if there is a war and a player is out of cards (therefore can't continue the war) that player loses \n",
    "\n",
    "e.g. if there are n = 3 players:\n",
    "- num_of_cards_per_player = 52 mod 3 = 17\n",
    "- num_of_cards_in_game = 17 * 3 = 51\n",
    "- deck = [2, 3, 3, 3, 3, 4, ...]\n",
    "\n",
    "Steps:\n",
    "1. Defining deck of cards and card values\n",
    "2. Defining variables for analysis: numer of rounds ...\n",
    "3. N simulations:\n",
    "    - shuffling cards and assigning them to n players (1 stack for hand and 1 stack for side cards)\n",
    "    - N loops:\n",
    "        1. move - comparison card values\n",
    "        2. if war, then: 1st move without comparison, 2nd move with comparison (check condition again - recurency)\n",
    "        3. add cards from the move to winner's side cards stack\n",
    "        4. if one of the players has all cards, then stop\n",
    "4. Analysis ..."
